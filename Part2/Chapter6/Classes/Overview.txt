Combining our data structure and functions = Classes

Object-Oriented Programming
    Objects contain code and data are modeled from Classes
    Clustering our logic(functions) alongside our data, better defining our goals

Class = a structure that can contain both data(variables) and logic(functions) in a single, reuseable container
    - classes don't do anything by themselves
    - When you want to make use of a class create an Object 
Methods = the logic(functions)
