Interfacing with SQLite
    Chapter Review
        - SQLite is a simple, cross-platform database engine
        - A table is like a spreadsheet with columns and rows
        - SQL statements can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data
    
    SELECT
        - select is the get function of SQLite
            - select * from tables limit 5;
                - select * = get all the columns 
                - from tables = from the plural of the table name 
                - limit 5 = I only want to see the first 5

    INSERT
        - adding a new row to the table selected
            - insert into tables (column1, column2) values (x, y);
                - insert into tables = the plural of the table you are going to be adding this row
                - (column1, column2) = the columns you would like to add to  
                - values (x, y) = the value you would like for the columns you selected

    UPDATE
        - Edit an existing row 
            - update tables set column1 = "value1", column2 = intValue where id = x;
                - update tables = the plural version of the table you would like to update
                - set column1 = "value1", column2 = intValue = find the columns and values you would like to edit 
                - where id = x; = find the row with the id value for editing

    DELETE
        - Delete an existing row 
            - delete from tables where id = x;
