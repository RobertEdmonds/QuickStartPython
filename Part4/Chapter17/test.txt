Test-Driver development
    Chapter Overview
        - Test-driven development makes for better code 
        - Unit testing ensures proper operation of foundation components
        - Strive for good test coverage
    - Test-driven development = a paradigm in programming that encourages developers to write a test first to make sure their code does what it is supposed to do, then write the function and run the test
    - Regression = which occurs when code that was previously working breaks

    Getting Started with Unit testing
        - Unit Testing = individual check on specific methods, functions, and other well-defined code blocks that ensure that the application is working as expected

    Assertions
        - lets us test the outputs of our code
        assertEqual
            - checks to see if the first value is equal to the second
        assertNotEqual
            - checks to see if the first value is not equal to the second
        assertTrue
            - checks to see if the statement is true 
        assertFalse
            - checks to see if the statement is false 
    
    Test Driven Design
        - The most common issue uncovered by test-driven development is lack of units within a program
        - Rather than having a long collection of lines of code that do a complicated task, break it down into simpler functions
