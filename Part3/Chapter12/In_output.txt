Input and Output
    Chapter Overview
        - Computers accept input, process data, and generate Output
        - Python can write and read to the disk in multiple modes and encoding schemes
        - Serialization lets us save an object to disk for later recreation
    - Computers do three main parts
        - Collecting Input 
        - Processing Those Data
        - Outputting Results
    - Phrase "Input and Output" = I/O 
        - Input = data that is provided to the computer 
        - Output = The result of computation and can be displayed on the screen, sent over network, or saved to disk

    Disk I/O 
        - Reading and writing text files
            - Text Files = simply files filled with string data
        - Sample disk_io.py(lines 2-18)
            - With the with statement paired with open(to open or create the file(fox.txt)),
                for writing or reading(mode="w"(for writing) mode="r"(for reading)),
                with an encoding of UTF-8
            - upon opening it returns a handle as f 
            - with the file being open we call f.write(data)(to write) or f.read()(to read)
        Reading Part of a File 
            - Sample disk_io.py(lines 13-14)
                - if you put a number in the f.read(16) it will read the first 16 characters
            - when you want to break it up into small chunks
                - you will have to switch the mode into binary(mode="rb") and you won't need to put the encoding 
                    - with open("fox.txt", mode="rb") as f:
                        - while (c := f.read(32)):
                            - do something
        Working with Multiple Lines 
            - A more useful way of reading text in chunks is with readlines method
                - with open("fox.txt", mode="r") as f:
                    while (line := f.readlines()):
                        # do something with the line 
        Standard I/O 
            -Standard Out(stdout) = output text to the screen 
            -Standard In(stdin) = receive input from the keyboard
            - Sample disk_io.py(lines 21-30)
        Serialization with Pickle
            - Serialization = The process of describing every detail of an object in a text format that is stored in a string 
            - Sample disk_io.py(lines 32-43)
            - customer.dat is a standard for binary data 
            - pickle can be insecure
