Debugging Python Code 
    Chapter Overview
        - Debugging is the art of finding and fixing problems in code 
        - Logging is very useful for finding bugs
        - VScode can be a huge help in debugging 
    
    Logging 
        - Logging = the process of writing diagnostic data to the screen 
            - i.e. print function 
        Displaying Data on the Screen 
            - Most often used techniques
                - print out the variable before, during and after whatever misbehaving function calls them 
            - Sample debug.py lines(2 - 13)
            - print("Reached first function")
            - print("Inside the Loop")
            - disadvantages 
                - It can get messy
            - We can create a function that displays the data we want to show only if a variable named debug is set to true 
                - Sample debug.py lines(15 - 20)
                - When launching we can set it to False
        Logging to Disk 
            - if we don't happen to see the debugging message, logging to disk is a helpful tool
            - more durable and provides a better record of more complex events
            - Sample debug.py lines(22 - 28)
                - import logging module
