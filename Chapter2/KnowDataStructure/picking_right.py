"""Picking The Right Data Type"""

# Lists are going to be the go-to solution for storing collections of data
# Sets are faster than lists in some cases,
    # but running many calculations on the data contained in a set can be slower
# Tuples for data that won't change and be added into many calculations,
    # when performance is critical
# If your data is complex or you think you'll add additional parts to a structure. Dictionary
